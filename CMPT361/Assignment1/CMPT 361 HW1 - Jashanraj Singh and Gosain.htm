<h4>Honor statement:</h4>
<p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. I may have asked questions about the assignment on Piazza, I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. I also already know that this class is graded on a curve. I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates. Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

<p>
    <br>
    In spatial domain for HP: The borderline between bricks seems to overlap the brick area.
</br>
    <br>
    In frequency domain representation of HP, we can notice collision between high frequency components which represent aliasing.
</br>
<br>    
In spatial domain of LP: There is minimal overlapping of components. 
</br>
<br>
In frequency domain representation of LP, everything outside the centre appear dark and minimal sign of aliasing (overlapping compoents) could be seen.
</br>
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    In spatial domain for HP: The borderline between bricks seems to overlap the brick area and the asymmetrical wave like patterns could be noticed as a sign of aliasing. 
</br>
    <br>
    In frequency domain representation of HP, we can notice high frequency components merged on a greater extent than normal which is caused by aliasing.
</br> 
<br>
    In spatial domain of LP: There is little overlapping of components. 
</br>
<br>
    In frequency domain representation of LP, everything outside the centre appear dark and minimal sign of aliasing could be seen.

<p>
    <br>
    For subsampling by (1:2:end), the size and deviation are 5 and 1 respectively. This kernel blur the image enough to prevent aliasing in the image. 
</br>
<br>
Frequency content for subsampling (by 2) without Anti-aliasing shows many bright spots and some merging into each other. 
</br> 
<br>
   If we observe the frequency content for sampling with Anti-aliasing, there are less bright spots and less merge into each other. 
</br>
<br>
    For subsampling by (1:4:end), the size and deviation are 10 and 1.5 respectively. 
</br>
<br>
    The blur effect reduce the aliasing effect on the image by removing low level information. 
</br>
<br>    Similar to the results for anti-aliasing in sampling by (1:2:end), the frequency content has much less bright spots in comparision to frequency content without blurring. 
</br>
<br>
    The bright areas outside the centre are less and no merge could be seen.

<h4>5: Canny edge detection thresholding</h4>

<p>
    <br>
    Optimal result excluded some edges in the corner and some bricks appear to be merged as the edge between cannot be detected by the optimal threshold.
</br>
    <br>
    LowLow threshold doesn't improve the edge detection in between bricks and the results are comparable to optimal case with little difference. 
</br>
    <br>
    highLow fails to detect many of the edges and underperform the former thresholds. 
</br>
    <br>
    highhigh further underforms all the former thresholds and with high threshold for edges it fails to detect most of the bricks. 
</br>
    <br>
    The best detection could be obtained using lowhigh, so ideally lowhigh provides the best results

<p>
    <br>
    Optimal result shows too many edges (noise) which needs to be eliminates. 
</br>
    <br>
    LowLow further amplify the noise in the image. 
</br>
    <br>
    highLow reduce the noise by a great extend and provide with a satisfactory result. 
</br>
    <br>
    lowHigh detects edges all around the image. 
</br>
    <br>
    Ideally, highhigh provide with the ideal result which exclude extra noise(edges) and identify all the features. 
</br>
    <br>
    The best results were obtained using highhigh.
